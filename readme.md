datetime for Zerynth
====================

This module supplies classes for manipulating dates, times, and deltas.
It represents a minimalistic implementation of Python module
[datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) for
[Zerynth](https://www.zerynth.com/) platform.

This module relays on the availability of `divmod()` and `round()` as
builtins (since Zerynth 2.6.1).
